# Wordle Game Clone

This project is a clone of the popular word puzzle game, Wordle. The goal of the game is to guess a five-letter word within six attempts, receiving feedback for each guess to guide the player towards the correct word. I worked on this when I first started coding in 2022 as I wanted to test out my skills at the time.

## Features

- **Interactive UI:** User-friendly interface that mimics the original Wordle game.
- **Guess Validation:** Ensures only valid five-letter words are accepted.
- **Feedback System:** Provides color-coded feedback for each guess:
  - **Green:** Correct letter in the correct position.
  - **Yellow:** Correct letter in the wrong position.
  - **White:** Incorrect letter.
- **Win/Loss Conditions:** Displays appropriate messages for winning or losing the game.

## Technologies Used

- Python
